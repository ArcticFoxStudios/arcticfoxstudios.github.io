    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>Thank you for comming across my diaries, well not really my diaries but rather the diaries of my current project "TreeFox"
       a 3rd person co-op adventure game inspired by the Jak & Daxter series of games. If thats something you think you would be
       interesting in then please do continue on i wont stop you. If its not somthing your interested in however i suppose i could
       write up my personal diaries but that would not be very entertaining. Either way i hope you enjoy.</p>
